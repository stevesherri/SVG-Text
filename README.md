# SVG-IText

This simple page loads an SVG and displays it on the canvas.  Each object is editable/draggable.  For reference it also contains an image of how the SVG displays in IE.

### ISSUES
- Line breaks not rendering to FabricJS canvas
- Text doesn't display in correct font until first mousedown/interaction
- When IText is created using the left/top positions from SVG text the text is positioned offscreen
